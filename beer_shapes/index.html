		<h1>Choosing the Right Beer Glass</h1>
		<p>A demo by <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com">Ryan Stewart</a> showing off some of the features in the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-exclusions/">CSS Exclusions specification</a>. The text content comes from <a href-"http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> with the exception of the Pokal glass. That's too specialized I guess.</p>

			<span class="heading">Irish Pint</span> The Republic of Ireland also uses 570 mL 1 pint glasses, where legal metrology marks are used to show that a glass has passed inspection by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, a state-run body who enforce a number of standard rulings. Starting in 2006, the NSAI "pint" mark, a circle featuring two wavy lines, between which "PINT" is written, with a year mark (last two digits), and a three digit batch code either side; has begun to be phased out with a European standard "PINT"/CE logo stamp. Smaller Pint glasses have been used in pubs and nightclubs though.</div>
		<div id="weissbierflute1" class="container weissbierflute">
			The traditional <span class="heading">Weissbier glass</span> has a rated capacity of one-half liter, plus additional room for the foam, is relatively slender, and tapers slightly towards the base. Pouring Weissbier into the glass requires a bit of practice, as one has to avoid producing too much head. The two techniques are illustrated here, performed by industrial robots programmed by students of two Bavarian universities: This robot demonstrates the technique of holding the opening of the bottle close to the rim of the glass, while this robot uses the faster, immersion technique preferred by bartenders. Note the swivelling of the nearly empty bottle: This serves to pick up the yeast, an important part to unfiltered beer's complete taste, although a controversy about this procedure exists. In fact, it was very uncommon to pick up the yeast until the 1970s when the first "Kristallweizen" hit the market in Germany. Due to the extremely bitter taste of yeast it was never supposed to be served with the beer, but to remain inside the bottle until then.</div>
		<div id="pintglass1" class="container pintglass">
			A <span class="heading">pint glass</span> is a drinking vessel made to hold either a British ("imperial") pint of 20 imperial fluid ounces (568 mL) or an American pint of 16 U.S. fluid ounces (470 mL). These glasses are used predominantly to serve beer. "Nonic" pint glass. The common shapes of pint glass are: Conical glasses are shaped, as the name suggests, as an inverted truncated cone around 6 inches (15 cm) tall and tapering by about 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter over its height. The nonic, a variation on the conical design, where the glass bulges out a couple of inches from the top; this is partly for improved grip, partly to prevent the glasses from sticking together when stacked, and partly to give strength and stop the rim from becoming chipped or "nicked".[1] The term "nonic" derives from from "no nick". Jug glasses, or "dimple mugs", are shaped more like a large mug with a handle. They are moulded with a grid pattern of thickened glass on the outside, somewhat resembling the segmentation of a WWII-era hand grenade. The dimples prevent the glass slipping out of the fingers in a washing-up bowl, and the design of the glass emphasises strength, also to withstand frequent manual washing.

		<div id="snifter1" class="container snifter">
			<span class="heading">A snifter</span> — also called a balloon — is a type of stemware, a short-stemmed glass whose vessel has a wide bottom and a relatively narrow top. It is mostly used to serve aged brown spirits such as brandy and whisky. The large surface area of the contained liquid helps evaporate it, the narrow top traps the aroma inside the glass, while the rounded bottom allows the glass to be cupped in the hand, thus warming the liquor. Most snifters will hold between 180–240 ml (6–8 oz.), but are almost always filled to only a small part of their capacity. Most snifters are designed so that when placed sideways on a flat surface, they will hold just the proper amount before spilling. The attributes that have made the snifter a popular glass for brandy have also made it the preferred glass for some styles of beer – mainly those that feature complex aromas and have an ABV measure of 8% or higher, such as the imperial stout, barleywine, and double India pale ale.

		<div id="pilsnerflute1" class="container pilsnerflute">A <span class="heading">pilsner glass</span> is used for many types of light beers, including pale lager or pilsner. Pilsner glasses are generally smaller than a pint glass, usually in 200 ml, 250 ml, 300 ml, 330 ml or 400 ml sizes (in Europe 500ml ones are not rare). They are tall, slender and tapered. The slender glass will reveal the colour, and carbonation of the beer, and the broad top will help maintain a beer head. Until the mid-1840s, most Bohemian beers were top-fermented. The taste and standards of quality often varied widely, and in 1838, consumers dumped whole barrels to show their dissatisfaction. The officials of Pilsen founded a city-owned brewery in 1839, called Bürger Brauerei (Citizens' Brewery - now Plzeňský Prazdroj), brewing beer according to the pioneering Bavarian style of brewing. Bavarian brewers had begun aging beer made with bottom-fermenting yeasts in caves (i.e.German: 'gelagert'), which improved the beer's clarity and shelf-life. Most of this research benefited from the knowledge already expounded on in a book (printed in German in 1794, in Czech in 1801), written by František Ondřej Poupě (Ger: Franz Andreas Paupie) (1753–1805) from Brno.

		<div id="tulipglass1" class="container tulipglass">A <span class="heading">tulip glass</span> not only helps trap the aroma, but also aids in maintaining large heads, creating a visual and olfactory sensation. The body is bulbous, but the top flares out to form a lip which helps head retention. It is recommended for serving Scottish ales, American double/imperial IPAs, barleywines, Belgian ales and other aromatic beers. Some pint glasses which taper outwards towards the top are also called tulip glasses, despite having notably less curvature.

		<div id="goblet1" class="container goblet">Belgian breweries have a tradition of providing custom beer glasses: with Trappist breweries, this often takes the form of providing <span class="heading">"chalice" or "goblet"</span> style glasses. The distinction between goblet and chalice is typically in the glass thickness. Goblets tend to be more delicate and thin, while the chalice is heavy and thick walled. Some chalices are even etched on the bottom to nucleate a stream of bubbles for maintaining a nice head.</div>
